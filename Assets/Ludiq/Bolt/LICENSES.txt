THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License."Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License."Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offers the Work under the terms of this License."Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work."Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License."You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";;to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR.

Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.8.

License: GNU Lesser General Public License v.3

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporatesthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General PublicLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNUGeneral Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface providedby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a modeof using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking anApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Librarywith which the Combined Work was made is also called the "LinkedVersion".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means theCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source codefor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, arebased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means theobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any dataand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from theApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this Licensewithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, afacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Applicationthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when thefacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modifiedversion:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material froma header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such objectcode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporatedmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structurelayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of theportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each ofthe following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked       Version. 

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side by side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by thisLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of yourchoice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such newversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but maydiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered versionof the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"applies to it, you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that published version or of any later versionpublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as youreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU LesserGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decidewhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shallapply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version ispermanent authorization for you to choose that version for theLibrary.
